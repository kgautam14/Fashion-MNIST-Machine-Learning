This is a description on how to run the provided code.

DataSets Needed:
To compile the following code, I used datasets from Kaggle for Fashion_MNIST. 
The datasets were as following:
	1. fashion-mnist_test.csv : contains the testing samples.
	2. fashion-mnist_train.csv : contains the training samples.


1. User will need to first run CleanData.ipynb, provided the two datasets are saved in the same folder.
2. This will create two new csv files with the modified data required for this assignment.
3. All three files, k-Fold Cross Validation.ipynb, LogRegFinal.ipynb, and SVMFinal.ipynb can then be compiled and executed.
